<b>
Pintos</b>

Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. <br>
It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. 
<br>In the Pintos projects, you and your project team will strengthen its support in all three of these areas.

<b>Project 1  -  Threads </b><br>

In this assignment, we were given a minimally functional thread system. My job was to extend the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems.
<br><br>Tasks included:
<ol>
<li> Implement thread_sleep functionality (calling thread goes to sleep for "x" ticks </li>
<li> Implement priority scheduling (handling locks/nested locks/priortiy donations) </li>
<li> Implement a MLFQ scheduler </li>
</ol>
